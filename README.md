# 📈 GARCH Model for Volatility Forecasting

This repository provides an implementation of the **GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)** model in Python for analyzing and forecasting financial time series volatility.  
GARCH models are widely used in **risk management**, **derivatives pricing**, and **algorithmic trading** to capture volatility clustering in asset returns.

## 🔮 Further Development Ideas

To make this project more valuable for researchers, investors, and stakeholders, here are possible extensions:

### 📊 Data & Markets
- Support for multiple asset classes (**crypto, FX, commodities**).  

### 📈 Model Enhancements
- Implement advanced models:
  - **Multivariate GARCH** for portfolio volatility.  
- Compare GARCH models with **machine learning approaches** (e.g., LSTMs, transformers for volatility forecasting).  

### 🛠️ Tools & Visualization
- Interactive dashboards (using **Streamlit** or **Dash**) for stakeholders to visualize forecasts.  
- Risk metrics (VaR, ES) derived from forecasted volatility.  
- Scenario analysis and stress testing tools.
